## PythonMVA
This repository contains the Python code snippets I coded while learning Python following the <b>"Introduction To Programming with Python"</b> MVA 2 days course.

The IDE used is <b>Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition</b>.

If you are also willing to use Visual Studio as an IDE then don't forget to install the <b>Python tools for Visual Studio</b>
Just google <b>'ptvs'</b> and you can get details about it and instructions for installation. 

The code snippets are coded by me and there is heavy use of comments.
If you want to use the code snippets just for learning purpose I hope that the comments will hepl you. 
You can fork it and I welcome any correction to the code/comments. 

Keep Coding !
