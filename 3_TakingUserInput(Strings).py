# the input function is used as a prompt and it takes the value from
# user and store it in the variable.

# We do not need to declare the datatype for a variable in Python
# 'userName' & 'userAge' are the variables in this program

# userName - camelCasing 
# UserName - PascalCase

userName = input("What is your name?")
userAge = input("What is your age ?")
